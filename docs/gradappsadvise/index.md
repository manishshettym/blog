# CS Grad School Applications
{: .fs-9 }

Hey there! I'm working on a series of blog posts where I will describe my experience with grad school applications. 

`Disclaimers`:
1. These posts describe a single individual's (me) experience ONLY and are not to be misconstrued as universal advice for any kind of success. I encourage all applicants to think for themselves and explore their own paths towards grad school. 
2. My experience (as of today) is from an applicant's perspective ONLY, and hence, I cannot speak on what the admission commitee is looking for.

That said, when I applied, I also found it helpful to read what previous applicants, professors, etc. had to say. Here are **Some reliable resources** that covers most of it:
1. [Kalpesh Krishna's](https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/2018/05/29/grad-resources.html) compilation of guides, advice, and more
2. [Jean Yang's](https://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2008/08/cs-grad-school-part-1-deciding-to-apply.html) experience and advice on the entire Ph.D. application process.
