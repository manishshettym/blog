# CS Grad School Applications
{: .fs-8 }

Hey there! These are series of blog posts where I will describe my experience with 2021-22 grad school applications. 
[Here are some disclaimers before you go ahead with these posts](#disclaimers).

When I applied, I also found it helpful to read similar posts describing what previous applicants, professors, etc. had to say. Here are **some more reliable resources** that I used that cover most of the advice on the internet:

1. [Kalpesh Krishna's](https://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/2018/05/29/grad-resources.html) compilation of guides, advice, and more.
2. [Prof. Jean Yang's](https://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2008/08/cs-grad-school-part-1-deciding-to-apply.html) experience and advice on the entire Ph.D. application process.
3. [Prof. Harchol's (CMU)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf) famous talk who should apply to grad school, what to expect, etc.

#### Motivation
My motivation with these posts is going primarily be to share my *unique experience* with grad school applications, published here to encourage and assist others when doing the same. I especially want to reach the many undergraduate students at lesser known universities in countries like India, encouraging them to consider research careers.

#### About Me
In 2020, I completed my undergraduate education in computer science at PES University, Bangalore, India. During undergrad, I got involved with multiple research projects and learnt what research entails. With a keen interest to explore it further, I worked at Microsoft Research (India) for 2+ years -- first as an Intern, and then as a pre-doctoral Research Fellow.

During my time at MSR, I worked on a large projects that touched every aspect of the research cycle: ideation, design, experimentation, productization, and publishing. This experience was influential in me identifying that I want to pursue a career in research and deciding to applied to grad school. Moreover, the MSR experience was critical for me to narrow down to a research area of interest.
