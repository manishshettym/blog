Work in Progress ...

<div style="display:none">
Hey there!

I'm working on this post where I will describe
my experience with writing a statement of purpose.
Things I will try to cover:

1. My process of writing an SoP.
2. A simple SoP structure.
3. What an SoP `should have`?
4. What an SoP `should not have`?
5. Other Links to "How to write a SoP", tips/tricks, tutorials, and guides.

Progress: ![5%](https://progress-bar.dev/5)

SoP Writing:
There is a ton of advice out there on how-to-write-a-winning SoP, but I personally found it most
useful to start from scratch. 


SoP Reviewing and Feedback:

I think the most important part of "writing" is "re-writing better".
In that regard, to polish any written material, feedback is critical. 
I found feedback really useful during the application process (esp. for my SoP).

But it is a given that you will hear contradictory arguments (just like paper reviews :P), that, at face value, will just
further increase the uncertainity in this whole process.I hence found to CRITICAL to sieve this feedback for the chunks of 
gold that would make or break my SoP. 

To do that, I first created a priority order for the feedback I was looking for.
This helped me pick-and-choose what I need to improve and what I can leave to keep the writing
fresh and unique to my experiences. Let me go over my this priority order:


1. My Own Feedback after a 10 day Marination:

2. Feedback from Mentors (a.k.a Letter Writers)

3. Feedback from PhD Students

4. Feedback from Application Support Programs (3rd person):

Find all the support programs from 2021-22 here [LINK]. 
These should mostly be available for upcoming cycles.
