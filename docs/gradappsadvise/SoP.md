# the statement of purpose

I truly believe there is no recipe on to how to write a statement of purpose. However, what I can share
are things that worked for me. So here are **5 factors** I think are important.

I. ***Writing Well***: This is obvious. But, make sure your idea of "well" is generally perceived the same. Some things to keep in mind: avoid passive voice, unnecessary adverbs, and flowery language.


II. ***Starting Early***: One thing that made me confident about my statement, was the time I spent baking it. Typical application deadlines are around mid-December. I started working on my statement in `August (T-5 months)`. Now, this is unusually early for some, but being early => less stressful & more feedback.


III. ***Writing from Scratch***: One of the key things that helped me write my SoP was actually writing it from scratch. One advantage of doing that is that your SoP, albeit technical, will sound personal. I went about writing from scratch in 2 phases:

- **Phase 1: Concretize**
    1. Make a prioritized list of research projects `P`
        1. Priority should consider `relevance` to the topics you want to pursue.
        2. Priority should consider `recency`. No one cares about interests from back in the day.
    2. Pick top `n` projects from `P`; `n <= 4`
    3. For each project: 
        1. Dump an active voice recital of your experience: This should include (1) problem and motivation, (2) approach, (3) experiments that failed OR succeeded, (4) results and achievements. Again, I found it useful to write this as if I was reciting/sharing my experience to a technical expert.
        2. Read and ensure YOUR contribution is clear. Showing that you more than just implemented someone else's ideas can be important.
        3. Finally, refine.

- **Phase 2: Connect**: Draw your work into a narrative that connects these projects. The narrative should convey research vision and ability -- What plans do you have for your future? What are some questions that motivate you to get up and do research? Why are they important? Here, it is important to stay disciplined and not stray from the "purpose". More about how I did this in the next section.


IV. ***Write about Research***: Keep your writing tight and about things that relate to your research abilities. One way to do this is to write solely about past research projects. But, it can get challenging to restrict your writing when you start to feel your SoP is bland. Consequently, you will most likely start to look for extraneous factors to connect the dots. <span style="color:red"><<*This is the point where you make or break your SoP*>></span>. Looking too hard for your "purpose" will naturally end up with you writing stories from when you were a tadpole or using flowery sentences. I overcame these obstacles by writing solely about research, but with *different abstractions*:
1. Low Level: When I talked about experiences, I dove into technical details, methods, achievements, and more.
2. High Level: Everywhere else, I wrote about research vision, research style, overarching questions, etc.

I believe this created a more readable and interesting statement for the reader to follow.

V. ***Get Feedback***: I think the most important part of "writing" is "re-writing better". In that regard, to polish any written material, feedback is critical. Once I had my first draft, I found it very useful to get feedback from multiple sources.

<span style="color:red">Disclaimer</span>: You will hear contradictory arguments (just like paper reviews :P), that, at face value, will just increase uncertainty in this process. I hence found it CRITICAL to sieve this feedback for chunks that would truly make or break my SoP. To do that systematically, I followed a priority order for feedback:

1. Feedback from Yourself: This was by far the best feedback. Just revisiting a piece of writing after a while (1/2 weeks) gives you a lot of perspective. Listen to yourself and make the edits.

2. Feedback from Mentors (a.k.a Letter Writers): These are the people who know your research the best (after you). Their advice on what to focus on/ignore is especially useful.

3. Feedback from PhD Students: These are the been-there-done-that folks. While their feedback is helpful, they might have very strong opinions on writing style. This is where you can filter advice more and try to understand if the narrative has been conveyed.

4. \+ Other: Recently universities themselves have started to provide feedback via Application Support Programs. Here are all the [support programs from 2021-22](https://twitter.com/jbhuang0604/status/1446981455683407873?s=20&t=gkPnErn1NJgIc7uXRGoRcg). These should mostly be available for upcoming cycles as well.


That should get you started. I hope this post has shared some new perspectives and approaches to systematically tackle some of your challenges. Good luck with your applications. ðŸ¤ž

#TODO: Upload my own SoP. Will do this soon.
