Work in Progress ...

<div style="display:none">
Hey there!

I'm working on this post where I will describe
my experience with writing a statement of purpose.
Things I will try to cover:

1. My process of writing an SoP.
2. A simple SoP structure.
3. What an SoP `should have`?
4. What an SoP `should not have`?
5. Other Links to "How to write a SoP", tips/tricks, tutorials, and guides.

Progress: ![5%](https://progress-bar.dev/5)
