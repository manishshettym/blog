# latent reflections
<i>~ a computer science researcher writing about tech, academia, grad school, research, and more. <a href="https://twitter.com/manishshettym">@manishshettym</a> on Twitter; <a href="https://manishshettym.github.io">manishshettym.github.io</a></i>


While I hike my way through new trails, I have found it useful to write down some notes, thoughts, and opinions. It has at times helped me keep up with things, and consequently, keep up good spirits (we'll see how this goes xD).

Conversations with many have suggested that others (mostly students) might benefit in making this a public spectacle. Thus beginneth another attempt at inconsistent writing to wrap my head around diverse experiences in research, academia, tech, travel, and life.
