Though I'm almost always involved in `"research-y"` ðŸ”¬ stuff, I have found it useful to jot down
some thoughts on the way. Conversations with many have suggested that others might benefit in
making this a public spectacle.

Consequently, this blog is my attempt to sporadically wrap my head around
diverse experiences in research, academia, tech, travel, and life.
